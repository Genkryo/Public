Request for Feedback – mTLS Implementation Options for Load Balancer Integration with CCASS

Dear [CCASS contact / Team],

As part of our security compliance initiative, we are working to enable mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication on our load balancer (LB) that connects to CCASS.
One key requirement of this implementation is to perform SSL offloading on the load balancer.

We have identified two potential solutions, and we would appreciate your feedback — especially regarding feasibility and whether other customers have implemented a similar setup.

Solution 1: Public Certificate with CCASS URL

Generate a certificate with www.ccass.com as the Common Name (CN) or within the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field.

Certificate generated by our internal certificate administration team (see attached requirements).

The LB will present this certificate during mTLS authentication.

Client → [Load Balancer (SSL offload + mTLS)]
          └──> Certificate CN/SAN = www.ccass.com
                 ↓
               CCASS


Questions:

Would CCASS allow the use of www.ccass.com in a client certificate for mTLS?

Has CCASS already supported a similar setup for other clients?

Solution 2: Internal Certificate with Private CN

Generate a certificate with an internal CN (e.g., ccass.internal.company.com).

Need to confirm how CCASS handles redirection between the public and SSO endpoints — static or dynamic redirect.

Also need to confirm if CCASS accepts direct connections to an internal URL for mTLS.

Client → [Load Balancer (SSL offload + mTLS)]
          └──> Certificate CN = internal.company.com
                 ↓
      (Redirection or direct access)
                 ↓
               CCASS / SSO


Questions:

How is the redirection from www.ccass.com to the SSO endpoint performed?

Would CCASS allow direct connections to an internal endpoint with client certificates?

Has CCASS seen other customers using this approach successfully?
