Proposal: Automated DNS Resolution Monitoring for APAC Sites
Objective

Implement automated DNS resolution checks across all APAC locations to continuously monitor the health and topology of our G5 GTM infrastructure. This will enhance troubleshooting efficiency, improve visibility, and proactively detect DNS issues impacting users.

Background & Problem

Currently, when DNS resolution issues occur in APAC, troubleshooting relies on manual checks from individual locations or proxy tools.
This approach:

Delays root cause identification

Lacks a centralized topology view

Makes it harder to correlate issues related to GTM (Global Traffic Management) routing

Increases operational workload during incidents

Solution Overview

Develop an automated system that periodically performs DNS queries from each APAC location against key services hosted behind our G5 GTM infrastructure.

Key idea: Simulate local user DNS resolution continuously and collect results centrally.

What the automation will do:

Run scheduled DNS queries from each location (e.g., hourly)

Capture GTM resolution details (IP, region pool, TTL, failure state)

Report data to a central dashboard for live visibility

Send alerts on abnormal behavior or unexpected routing

Benefits
Category	Value Delivered
Service Reliability	Early detection of DNS/GTM routing failures
Troubleshooting Speed	Immediate access to resolution patterns from all APAC sites
Architecture Visibility	A clear topology overview of DNS resolution distribution
Operational Efficiency	Reduces manual checks + quicker escalation decisions
Scope

Initial deployment in APAC region

Include all critical internal & customer-facing endpoints behind GTM

Output: Dashboard (Grafana / Splunk / PowerBI) + alerting via Ops channels (Slack/Teams)

Technical Approach (High Level)

Use small probe scripts deployed in each location (e.g., via existing monitoring agents/Jumphosts)

Perform DNS lookups via local resolvers

Store results in central DB/log analytics pipeline

Visualize results in monitoring dashboard

Define thresholds & alerting logic

Success Criteria

✅ Near real-time visibility into DNS routing across APAC
✅ Reduction in time to diagnose DNS/GTM incidents
✅ Ability to detect routing anomalies automatically

Dependencies / Collaboration

Coordination with Network Ops for endpoint list & location coverage

Monitoring/Observability team for dashboard integration

Alignment with GTM architecture standards

Next Steps
